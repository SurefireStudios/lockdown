```
[cal_user_info field="display_name"]
```

With avatar:
```
[cal_user_info field="display_name" show_avatar="true" avatar_size="50"]
```

Show different content for logged-in vs logged-out users:
```
[cal_login_status logged_in_content="Welcome back!" logged_out_content="Please log in to continue."]
```

## Troubleshooting Installation

### Plugin Not Appearing
- Make sure the plugin folder is named `custom-auth-lockdown`
- Check that all files are uploaded correctly
- Verify your WordPress meets the minimum requirements (WP 5.0+, PHP 7.4+)

### Forms Not Working
- Ensure you've added the correct shortcodes to your pages
- Check that JavaScript is enabled in your browser
- Verify there are no JavaScript errors in the browser console

### Lockdown Not Working
- Make sure "Enable Site Lockdown" is checked
- Verify you've selected allowed pages
- Check that you're testing with a non-logged-in user

### Styling Issues
- The plugin includes basic styling that should work with most themes
- You may need to add custom CSS to match your theme perfectly
- Check the browser developer tools for CSS conflicts

## Common Redirect Examples

### Example 1: Simple Member Dashboard
- Create a page called "Member Dashboard"
- Set it as the "Login Redirect Page"
- All users will go there after login

### Example 2: Role-Based Login Redirects
- **Administrators**: Redirect to `/wp-admin/` (WordPress dashboard)
- **Editors**: Redirect to `/wp-admin/edit.php` (Posts list)
- **Subscribers**: Redirect to `/members-area/` (Custom members page)

### Example 3: Role-Based Logout Redirects
- **Administrators**: Redirect to `/wp-admin/` (Stay in admin area)
- **Premium Members**: Redirect to `/thank-you-premium/` (Thank you page)
- **Regular Members**: Redirect to `/` (Home page)
- **Subscribers**: Redirect to `/goodbye/` (Goodbye message)

### Example 4: Membership Site Structure
```
ðŸ“„ Home (public)
ðŸ“„ About (public)
ðŸ“„ Pricing (public)
ðŸ“„ Login (public - [cal_login_form])
ðŸ“„ Register (public - [cal_register_form])
ðŸ“„ Member Dashboard (private - redirect destination)
ðŸ“„ Premium Content (private)
ðŸ“„ User Profile (private)
```
